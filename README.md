# Sports Video Analysis System

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing sports videos, specifically designed to detect and track **players**, **referees**, and the **ball**, and to **separate teams** based on jersey color. The system uses YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for frame processing and video generation.

##  Features

-  Detect players, referees, and the ball
-  Separate players by team colors (Team A vs Team B)
-  Track objects using Kalman Filter
-  Output processed video with bounding boxes and team labels
