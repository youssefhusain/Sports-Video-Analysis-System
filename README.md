# Sports-Video-Analysis-System
This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing sports videos, specifically designed to detect and track **players**, **referees**, and the **ball**, and to **separate teams** based on jersey color. The system uses YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for frame processing and video generation.
